Bootstrapping Single-Malt-JS
============================

Bootstrapping might be the wrong term for this, so I hope that I don't have a mob (tuple?) of language zealots chasing after me with their meta-pitchforks. Now that the trolling is out of hte way, I should probably introduce you to this project: Single Malt JS. This project is an attempt to demystify a modern front-end stack. Nowadays you need a number of supporting libraries to build a productive base for a single page app, which have a tendency to be wrapped up in opionated frameworks that are adopted wholesale. This isn't a bad thing -- it's a sign that Javascript is finally maturing to the point where we need to worry about architecting large applications. One downside is that these frameworks tend to "mystify" (for lack of a better term) some of the concepts used to build them. It's easy to pick up something like Angular.js, and assume that it's a modern feat of software engineering capable of being built only by the brightest at Google. I'm hoping to poke some wholes in that strawman. I believe most of the conceps present in large frameworks can rise organically from building an application from scratch, as long as you follow a few principles.
